                <p class="article-body">Life can get complicated really quickly, but it doesn't have to be! There are
                    many ways to simplify
                    your
                    life, a few of which we've explored in the past. This week we're taking a bit of a approach though,
                    in
                    how you can find simplicity in the life you already living. </p>

                        you have to eat
                        healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.

                        their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as
                        possible, it will help balance everything out. </p>

                        decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying
                        simple will help draw the eye where you want it to and make things pop like never before. </p>
